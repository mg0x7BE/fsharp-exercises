# Simple F# Exercises

A collection of simple F# exercises paired with solutions. All tasks were fully generated by **Anthropic Claude**.

## How to Use

These scripts are designed for a **REPL** (Read–eval–print loop) workflow. This means you can run code interactively, line by line, without compiling the whole project.

The easiest way to work with these files is using **JetBrains Rider** (best IDE for F#)

1. Open a `.fsx` file.
2. Highlight a section of code.
3. Execute it using **Send Selection to F# Interactive**.
4. Default shortcut: `Ctrl` + `\`
