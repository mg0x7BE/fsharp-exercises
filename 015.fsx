(*
    Your Task:
    1. Define a DU called PaymentMethod with three cases:
       - Cash
       - Card of cardNumber: string
       - BankTransfer of accountNumber: string
    
    2. Create a function called describePayment that:
       - Takes a PaymentMethod
       - Returns a string description:
         - "Paid with cash" for Cash
         - "Paid with card: {cardNumber}" for Card
         - "Paid via bank transfer: {accountNumber}" for BankTransfer
    
    3. Create a list of 3 different payments using all three methods.
    
    4. Use List.map with describePayment to get descriptions.
    
    5. Print all descriptions.
    
    Expected output (as a list):
    ["Paid with cash"; "Paid with card: 1234-5678"; "Paid via bank transfer: ACC-999"]
